258. Add Digits My Submissions Question
Total Accepted: 61448 Total Submissions: 128227 Difficulty: Easy
Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

For example:

Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

Hint:

A naive implementation of the above process is trivial. Could you come up with other methods?
What are all the possible results?
How do they occur, periodically or randomly?
